# Introduction to Computer Vision

Welcome to week 2 of the course! In week 1 you learned all about how Machine Learning and Deep Learning is a new programming paradigm. This week youâ€™re going to take that to the next level by beginning to solve problems of computer vision with just a few lines of code! Check out this conversation between Laurence and Andrew where they discuss it and introduce you to Computer Vision!

## Learning Objectives

- Use callback functions for tracking model loss and accuracy during training.
- Make predictions on how the layer size affects network predictions and training speed.
- Implement pixel value normalization to speed up network training.
- Build a multilayer neural network for classifying the Fashion MNIST image dataset.
