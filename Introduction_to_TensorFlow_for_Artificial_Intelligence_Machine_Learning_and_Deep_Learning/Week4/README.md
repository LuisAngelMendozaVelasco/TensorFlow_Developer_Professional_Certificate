# Using Real-world Images

Last week you saw how to improve the results from your deep neural network using convolutions. It was a good start, but the data you used was very basic. What happens when your images are larger, or if the features aren’t always in the same place? Andrew and Laurence discuss this to prepare you for what you’ll learn this week: handling complex images!

## Learning Objectives

- Reflect on the possible shortcomings of your binary classification model implementation.
- Execute image preprocessing with the Keras ImageDataGenerator functionality.
- Carry out real life image classification by leveraging a multilayer neural network for binary classification.
