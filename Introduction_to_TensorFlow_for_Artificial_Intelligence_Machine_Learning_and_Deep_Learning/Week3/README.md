# Enhancing Vision with Convolutional Neural Networks

Welcome to week 3! In week 2 you saw a basic Neural Network for Computer Vision. It did the job nicely, but it was a little naive in its approach. This week weâ€™ll see how to make it better, as discussed by Laurence and Andrew here.

## Learning Objectives

- Use callback functions to interrupt training after meeting a threshold accuracy.
- Test the effect of adding convolution and MaxPooling to the neural network for classifying Fashion MNIST images on classification accuracy.
- Explain and visualize how convolution and MaxPooling aid in image classification tasks.
