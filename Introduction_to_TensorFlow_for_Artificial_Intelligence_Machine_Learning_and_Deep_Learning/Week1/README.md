# A New Programming Paradigm

Welcome to this course on going from Basics to Mastery of TensorFlow. We're excited you're here! In Week 1, you'll get a soft introduction to what Machine Learning and Deep Learning are, and how they offer you a new programming paradigm, giving you a new set of tools to open previously unexplored scenarios. All you need to know is some very basic programming skills, and you'll pick the rest up as you go along. To get started, check out the first video, a conversation between Andrew and Laurence that sets the theme for what you'll study...

## Learning Objectives

- Monitor the accuracy of the housing price predictions.
- Analyze housing price predictions that come from a single layer neural network.
- Use TensorFlow to build a single layer neural network for fitting linear models.
