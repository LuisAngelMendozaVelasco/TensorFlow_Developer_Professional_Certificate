# Transfer Learning

Building models for yourself is great, and can be very powerful. But, as you've seen, you can be limited by the data you have on hand. Not everybody has access to massive datasets or the compute power that's needed to train them effectively. Transfer learning can help solve this -- where people with models trained on large datasets train them, so that you can either use them directly, or, you can use the features that they have learned and apply them to your scenario. This is Transfer learning, and you'll look into that this week!

## Learning Objectives

- Master the keras layer type known as dropout to avoid overfitting.
- Achieve transfer learning in code using the keras API.
- Code a model that implements Kerasâ€™ functional API instead of the commonly used Sequential model.
- Learn how to freeze layers from an existing model to successfully implement transfer learning.
- Explore the concept of transfer learning to use the convolutions learned by a different model from a larger dataset.
