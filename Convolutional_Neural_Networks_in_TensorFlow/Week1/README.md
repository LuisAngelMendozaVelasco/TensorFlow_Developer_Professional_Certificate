# Exploring a Larger Dataset

In the first course in this specialization, you had an introduction to TensorFlow, and how, with its high level APIs you could do basic image classification, and you learned a little bit about Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets). In this course you'll go deeper into using ConvNets will real-world data, and learn about techniques that you can use to improve your ConvNet performance, particularly when doing image classification!In Week 1, this week, you'll get started by looking at a much larger dataset than you've been using thus far: The Cats and Dogs dataset which had been a Kaggle Challenge in image classification!

## Learning Objectives

- Gain understanding about Kerasâ€™ utilities for pre-processing image data, in particular the ImageDataGenerator class.
- Develop helper functions to move files around the filesystem so that they can be fed to the ImageDataGenerator.
- Learn how to plot training and validation accuracies to evaluate model performance.
- Build a classifier using convolutional neural networks for performing cats vs dogs classification.
