# Multiclass Classifications

You've come a long way, Congratulations! One more thing to do before we move off of ConvNets to the next module, and that's to go beyond binary classification. Each of the examples you've done so far involved classifying one thing or another -- horse or human, cat or dog. When moving beyond binary into Categorical classification there are some coding considerations you need to take into account. You'll look at them this week!

## Learning Objectives

- Build a multiclass classifier for the Sign Language MNIST dataset.
- Learn how to properly set up the ImageDataGenerator parameters and the model definition functions for multiclass classification.
- Understand the difference between using actual image files vs images encoded in other formats and how this changes the methods available when using ImageDataGenerator.
- Code a helper function to parse a raw CSV file which contains the information of the pixel values for the images used.
